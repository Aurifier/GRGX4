GRGX4
=====

The Grassius Regulatory Grid eXplorer.

This is the 4th incarnation of the GRG-X.

The first avatar was written in Perl, using cytoscape-web (crappy flash app). It still lives at grassius.org.
The second avatar was the shortest lived, an ephemeral PHP almost-disaster.
The third avatar was to be written in Grails, alas it was not to be.
For behold, Jeffrey was all like "hey I'm building a REST service for Grassius should I just stick your data in there?"

Thus, the final descendant in a long line of half-started projects, will be only a web front-end. But woe to the wicked,
for this manifestation will rise to vanquish its great evil ancestor, the crappy flash app GRGX 1.0.
